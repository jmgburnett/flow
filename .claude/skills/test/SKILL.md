# Vitest Testing

## Commands

Run all tests:
```bash
pnpm test
```

Run with coverage:
```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

Run specific package:
```bash
pnpm --filter web test
```

Watch mode:
```bash
pnpm --filter web test:watch
```

Run specific test file:
```bash
pnpm --filter web test -- --run path/to/test.test.ts
```

Run tests by pattern:
```bash
pnpm --filter web test -- --run --testNamePattern "pattern"
```

## Instructions

1. Clarify which tests to run (all, specific package, pattern)
2. Run the appropriate command
3. Show results and any failure details
4. For failures, offer to help debug

## Convex Function Tests

Convex function tests use `convex-test` with an in-memory backend — no external services needed.
Tests in `__tests__/convex/` automatically run in the `edge-runtime` environment.
See `__tests__/utils/test-db.ts` for the shared `createConvexTest()` helper.

## Test Structure

- `apps/web/__tests__/` - Main test directory
- `apps/web/__tests__/convex/` - Convex function integration tests
- `apps/web/__tests__/utils/` - Test utilities (test-db.ts, mocks.ts)
- `apps/web/__tests__/factories/` - Data factories
- `apps/web/vitest.config.mts` - Vitest configuration
- `apps/web/vitest.setup.ts` - Test setup file
