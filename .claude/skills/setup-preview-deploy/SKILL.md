# Convex Preview Deploy Key Setup

## What is a Preview Deploy Key?

A Convex preview deploy key enables automatic preview deployments — isolated Convex backends for each git branch. When `npx convex deploy` runs with a preview deploy key, it automatically creates a branch-scoped deployment.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Generate a Preview Deploy Key

1. Go to [https://dashboard.convex.dev](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **Deploy Keys**
4. Click **Generate Preview Deploy Key**
5. Copy the key (starts with `prod:` or `preview:`)

### 2. Configure Hatch

Run the following command with the key you copied:

```bash
hatch set-preview-deploy-key <your-key> --project <project-name>
```

This will:
- Save the key to your project record
- Set `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` as a Vercel preview environment variable

### 3. Verify

After setting the key, you can create feature VMs:

```bash
hatch feature <feature-name> --project <project-name>
```

## How It Works

- **Vercel preview builds**: The preview deploy key is set as `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` for the preview environment. When Vercel builds a preview deployment, `npx convex deploy --cmd 'pnpm build'` uses this key to create a branch-scoped Convex deployment automatically.
- **Feature VMs**: `hatch feature` and `hatch spike` pull the preview deploy key from Vercel env vars and use it to create a preview deployment on the VM.
- **Cleanup**: Preview deployments are automatically cleaned up by Convex — no manual project deletion needed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Convex preview deploy key not configured" error
Run `hatch set-preview-deploy-key <key> --project <name>` to configure it.

### Preview deployment not created
Ensure the key is valid and has the correct permissions. Generate a new key from the Convex dashboard if needed.

## Instructions

1. Ask the user which project they want to configure
2. Guide them through generating a key in the Convex dashboard
3. Help them run the `hatch set-preview-deploy-key` command
4. Verify the setup works with a test feature VM if desired
