description: Risk policy and pre-PR validation

## Risk Contract

The project uses a risk contract defined in `harness.json`. This file classifies paths by risk tier (critical, high, normal) and defines required checks.

## Pre-PR Validation

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
pnpm harness:pre-pr
```

This checks:
- Risk tier of changed files
- Documentation drift (docs/ reflects current code)
- Type checking passes
- Tests pass

## Documentation

- Architecture overview: `docs/architecture.md`
- Coding patterns: `docs/patterns.md`
- Troubleshooting: `docs/troubleshooting.md`

Keep docs in sync with code changes. If you modify a system described in `docs/`, update the relevant doc file.
