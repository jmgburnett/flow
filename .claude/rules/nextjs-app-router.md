## App Router Structure

- Route groups use parentheses: `(auth)`, `(app)`, `(marketing)`.
- Co-located components go in `_components/` directories within route groups.
- Shared components live in `apps/web/components/`.
- UI primitives from shadcn/ui are in `apps/web/components/ui/`.

## Server vs Client Components

- Components are Server Components by default — no directive needed.
- Add `"use client"` only when using hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs.
- Use the `use()` hook in client components to unwrap promises passed from server components.
- Keep data fetching in server components; pass data down as props.

## Import Conventions

- Use `@/` path alias for imports within `apps/web` (maps to app root).
- Example: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`

## UI Evidence

When building or modifying UI, capture visual evidence with `agent-browser`:
1. `agent-browser open http://localhost:3000/<route>`
2. `agent-browser snapshot -i` to verify the rendered output
