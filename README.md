# flow

A full-stack monorepo built with [Hatch](https://github.com/collinschaafsma/hatch).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (`corepack enable`)

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

Run the interactive setup script to configure GitHub, Vercel, and Convex:

```bash
pnpm app:setup
```

This will:
- Create a GitHub repository (or link to existing)
- Set up a Vercel project
- Create a Convex project and deploy schema
- Pull environment variables

### Manual Setup

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local
   ```

2. Fill in your environment variables in `apps/web/.env.local`

3. Start the Convex dev server (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   pnpm convex:dev
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Convex
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Convex deployment URL (set by `npx convex dev`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` - Convex HTTP actions URL (e.g. `https://adjective-animal-123.convex.site`)
- `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` - Deploy key for production deployments (Vercel env var)

### Authentication
Better Auth (runs inside Convex):
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Auth encryption secret (set as Convex env var)
- `SITE_URL` - App URL for auth callbacks (set as Convex env var)
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` - Auth callback URL

### Analytics
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` - PostHog public key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` - PostHog host
- `POSTHOG_API_KEY` - PostHog server-side key

---

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `checks.yml` | Pull request | Runs linting and type checking |
| `test.yml` | Pull request | Runs Vitest tests |

## Agent Harness

This project includes an agent harness that provides risk-aware merge policies, documentation drift detection, and browser evidence capture. The harness is defined in `harness.json` at the project root.

### Harness Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pnpm harness:risk-tier` | Compute risk tier of current changes |
| `pnpm harness:risk-tier --json` | Machine-readable risk tier output |
| `pnpm harness:docs-drift` | Check if docs need updating |
| `pnpm harness:pre-pr` | Full pre-PR validation (build + lint + typecheck + test + risk) |
| `pnpm harness:ui:capture-browser-evidence` | Screenshot changed UI routes via agent-browser |
| `pnpm harness:ui:verify-browser-evidence` | Verify screenshots exist for changed UI files |

### Risk Tiers

Changes are classified by the files they touch:

| Tier | Files | Merge Policy |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **High** | Schema, auth, security config | Human review required + all checks pass |
| **Medium** | API routes, Convex functions | Auto-merge with all checks passing |
| **Low** | Everything else | Checks pass |

### Evidence Capture

The browser evidence scripts capture screenshots of changed UI routes:

1. Start the dev server (`pnpm dev`)
2. Run `pnpm harness:ui:capture-browser-evidence`
3. Screenshots are saved to `.harness/evidence/` (gitignored)
4. Set `DEV_URL` environment variable to override the default localhost URL

### Branch Protection

Branch protection is auto-applied during project setup. By default, admins can bypass (suitable for solo development). Use `hatch harden --strict` to enforce on admins too (recommended for teams).

### Testing the Harness

1. **Check risk tier:**
   ```bash
   pnpm harness:risk-tier
   ```

2. **Make a high-risk change and re-check:**
   ```bash
   # Edit apps/web/convex/schema.ts, then:
   pnpm harness:risk-tier           # Should show "high"
   ```

3. **Check documentation drift:**
   ```bash
   pnpm harness:docs-drift
   ```

4. **Run full pre-PR validation:**
   ```bash
   pnpm harness:pre-pr
   ```

5. **Test browser evidence capture:**
   ```bash
   pnpm harness:ui:capture-browser-evidence
   pnpm harness:ui:verify-browser-evidence
   ```

## Backend Environments

This project uses Convex with separate projects for isolated environments:

| Environment | Backend | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Production** | Main Convex project | Live application (deployed via Vercel build) |
| **Preview** | Separate Convex project per branch | Vercel preview deployments |
| **Development** | Dev deployment | Local development (`npx convex dev`) |
| **Feature VMs** | Separate Convex project | Isolated feature development (created by `hatch feature`) |

### Production Deployments

When code is merged to main, Vercel automatically:
1. Runs `npx convex deploy` to deploy schema and functions
2. Builds the Next.js application
3. Deploys to Vercel

### Preview Deployments

Each feature branch gets its own Convex project so preview deployments are fully isolated. This is managed automatically by `hatch feature`:

1. **Per-branch env vars** — `hatch feature` sets `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` as Vercel env vars scoped to the feature branch's preview deployments via the Vercel API.

2. **Build command** — `vercel.json` uses a conditional build:
   - **Production**: `npx convex deploy && pnpm build` deploys to the main Convex project.
   - **Preview**: Unsets `VERCEL` and `VERCEL_ENV` before running `npx convex deploy` so the Convex CLI accepts the feature project's production deploy key in a non-production Vercel environment. The Next.js build runs separately afterward.

3. **Auth URL resolution** — The auth client uses `window.location.origin` in the browser so auth requests always target the current deployment's origin. This avoids CORS mismatches between preview URLs. The Convex backend's Better Auth config includes `trustedOrigins` with `*.vercel.app` and `*.exe.xyz` wildcards to accept requests from any preview or VM origin.

4. **Cleanup** — `hatch clean` removes the per-branch Vercel env vars and deletes the feature Convex project.

The `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` env var in Vercel authorizes the deployment.

## Deployment

### Vercel

The project is configured for Vercel deployment with automatic Convex deploys:

1. Link your project:
   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` - Production deploy key from Convex dashboard
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` - Convex deployment URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` - Convex HTTP actions URL

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

Convex functions deploy automatically during the build via `vercel.json`. See [Preview Deployments](#preview-deployments) above for how preview builds are handled.
